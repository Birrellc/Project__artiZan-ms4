This project has been tested throughout with the use of preview, DevTools, manual testing which allowed me to test every feature as I implemented them, at the end of the process i completed all the tests on my live deployment on Heroku App.

## Validation Testing

Validation testing for HTML, CSS, JS & Python:

### HTML

- For HTML testing I ran my code through [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) by URI validation using my [Deployed Live Site](https://artizan-prints.herokuapp.com/).
- On first try I received multiple formatting errors for my nav pages but nothing else in which i have placed list elements without and unordered list.
- I rectified the errors and now when I paste the Website URL in the formatter I receive no errors as displayed below.

### CSS

- For CSS testing I first put my **base.css** code through [Auto Prefixer CSS](https://autoprefixer.github.io) to make sure my CSS has all the correct vendor prefixes.
- The commit showing these changes being implemented can be found [Here](https://github.com/Birrellc/artiZan-ms4/commit/4236c4dde0ddee1c57d516f0a3dadc12c40869fc)
- I then proceeded to run my code through [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and received no errors as shown in the image below.
- I also then applied a red border to all my elements to check for any overflow issues & there are none.

### Python

- For Python testing I ran my code through [Pep8 Online](http://pep8online.com/).
- I ran all my python files through this validator and came up with no serious code breaking errors only the occasional line length and no new line issues
- I have chosen not to display images for this test due to the number of files tested.
